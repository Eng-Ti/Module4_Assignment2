        <p><b><i>Hi, my name is Tina Namalima. I think I love technology, 
        I mean, there are so many amazing things that we now can do 
        because of technology. Look at us studying online, something 
        which wasn't possible some years back. Amazing right?</b></i></p>

        <p>So far i've leart about HTMl and CSS. I can now confidently
         use VS code to write a basic website in HTML and color it up 
         and make it more appealing with CSS then push it to my github
         account. CSS is important because it brings design flexibility
         and interactivity and gives the developer control over the page 
         layout allowing one to make precise section-wise changes.</p>

        <!-- <h1>Third Section</h1> -->
        <p>The easiest way to explain the difference between paddings, 
        borders and margins is using the Box model; see the figure below: </p>
        <img src="./Box_model.PNG" alt="Box Model" width="250px" height="250px">
        <p>In the Box model above, consider the content of the box which is the 
        position where texts and images appear. The padding is thus the space 
        between the border and the content - i.e. the padding clears the area 
        around the content and the border goes around the padding and content.
        The margin clears an area outside the border - it is the space between 
        the border and the next element of the design and goes around i.e. it 
        is the space outside the border and between it and the other elements.
